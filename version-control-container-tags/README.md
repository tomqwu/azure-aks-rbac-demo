## Tagging: 

Assign meaningful tags to your container images using semantic versioning (e.g., my-image:v1.0.0). Avoid using mutable tags like latest for production deployments, as they can lead to inconsistencies and make tracking changes difficult.

## Azure Container Registry (ACR): 

Use ACR as the centralized registry to store and manage your container images. ACR integrates seamlessly with Azure services and provides features such as access control, vulnerability scanning, and versioning.

## Immutable image builds: 

Ensure each build corresponds to a unique tag in ACR, creating immutable image builds. This practice helps prevent overwriting existing images and allows easy rollback to previous versions if needed.

## Automated builds with Azure DevOps: 

Set up automated build pipelines using Azure DevOps to build and push container images to ACR. This ensures consistency across your images and promotes a reliable release process.

## Source control: 

Store your Dockerfiles and any related configuration files in a Git repository, which can be connected to Azure DevOps. This allows you to track changes, collaborate with your team, and ensure that your container images are built from a consistent source.

## Scanning and vulnerability management with Azure Defender for Containers: 

Enable Azure Defender for Containers to automatically scan your container images in ACR for vulnerabilities. Regularly review and address any identified vulnerabilities by updating the affected images.

## Audit and monitoring: 

Use Azure Monitor and Azure Log Analytics to monitor the usage of your container images across your deployments, and maintain an audit trail of image versions, tags, and related metadata. This information can be crucial for troubleshooting and understanding the impact of changes in your images.
